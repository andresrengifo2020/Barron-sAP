Here is a typical source file for a Java program.
/** Program FirstProg.java
Start with a comment, giving the program name and a brief
description of what the program does.
*/
import package1.*;
import package2.subpackage.ClassName;
public class FirstProg //note that the file name is FirstProg.java
{
public static type1 method1(parameter list)
{
< code for method 1 >
}
public static type2 method2(parameter list)
{
< code for method 2 >
}
...
public static void main(String[] args)
{
< your code >
}
}

1. All Java methods must be contained in a class, and all program statements must be placed inside a method
2. Typically, the class that contains the main method does not contain many additional methods
3. The words class, public, static, void, and main are reserved words, also called keywords.
4. The keyword public signals that the class or method is usable outside of the class, whereas private data members or methods (see Chapter 2) are not.
5. The keyword static is used for methods that will not access any objects of a class, such as the methods in the FirstProg class in the example on the previous page. This is typically true for all methods in a source file that contains no instance variables (see Chapter 2). Most methods in Java do operate on objects
and are not static. The main method, however, must always be static.

TYPES AND IDENTIFIERS
An identifier is a name for a variable, parameter, constant, user-defined method, or user-defined class
By convention identifiers for variables and methods are lowercase. Uppercase letters are used to separate these into multiple words, for example getName, findSurfaceArea, preTaxTotal, and so on. Note that a class name starts with a capital letter. Reserved
words are entirely lowercase and may not be used as identifiers.

BUILT-IN TYPES
very identifier in a Java program has a type associated with it. The primitive or built-
in types that are included in the AP Java subset are
int An integer. For example, 2, -26, 3000
boolean A boolean. Just two values, true or false
double A double precision floating-point number.
For example, 2.718, -367189.41, 1.6e4

Storage of Numbers
There are two Java constants that you
should know. Integer.MAX_VALUE holds the maximum value an int can hold, 231 − 1.
Integer.MIN_VALUE holds the minimum value an int can hold, −231.
Built-in types in Java are byte (one byte), short (two bytes), int (four bytes), and
long (eight bytes). Of these, only int is in the AP Java subset.
