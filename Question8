A method is to be written to search an array for a value that is larger than a
given item and return its index. The problem specification does not indicate
what should be returned if there are several such values in the array. Which of
the following actions would be best?

(A) The method should be written on the assumption that there is only one
value in the array that is larger than the given item.
(B) The method should be written so as to return the index of every occurrence
of a larger value.
(C) The specification should be modified to indicate what should be done if
there is more than one index of larger values.
(D) The method should be written to output a message if more than one larger
value is found.
(E) The method should be written to delete all subsequent larger items after a
suitable index is returned

Answer
8. (C) Here is one of the golden rules of programming: Donâ€™t start planning the
program until every aspect of the specification is crystal clear. A programmer
should never make unilateral decisions about ambiguities in a specification.
