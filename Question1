Consider this inheritance hierarchy, in which Novel and Textbook are subclasses
of Book.
Book
Novel Textbook
Which of the following is a false statement about the classes shown?
(A) The Textbook class can have private instance variables that are in neither
Book nor Novel.
(B) Each of the classes—Book, Novel, and Textbook—can have a method
computeShelfLife, whose code in Book and Novel is identical, but different from the code in Textbook.
(C) If the Book class has private instance variables title and author, then Novel
and Textbook cannot directly access them.
(D) Both Novel and Textbook inherit the constructors in Book.
(E) If the Book class has a private method called readFile, this method may not
be accessed in either the Novel or Textbook classes

Answer

D) Constructors are never inherited. If a subclass has no constructor, the default
constructor for the superclass is generated. If the superclass does not have a
default constructor, a compile-time error will occur.
