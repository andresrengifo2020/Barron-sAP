The boolean expression a[i] == max || !(max != a[i]) can be simplified to
(A) a[i] == max
(B) a[i] != max
(C) a[i] < max || a[i] > max
(D) true
(E) false


(A) The expression !(max != a[i]) is equivalent to max == a[i], so the given
expression is equivalent to a[i] == max || max == a[i], which is equivalent to
a[i] == max.
