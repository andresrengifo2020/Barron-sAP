. The color of a pixel can be represented using the RGB (Red, Green, Blue) color
model, which stores values for red, green, and blue, each ranging from 0 to 255.
How many bits (binary digits) would be needed to represent a color in the RGB
model?
(A) 8
(B) 16
(C) 24
(D) 32
(E) 40


Answer
(C) 8 bits (1 byte) are required to represent the values from 0 to 255. The base 2
number 11111111 represents 1+2+4+8+16+32+64+128 = 255. Since there
are 3 such values in an RGB representation, (8)(3) = 24 bits are needed.
