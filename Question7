7. Consider the following loop, where n is some positive integer.
for (int i = 0; i < n; i += 2)
{
if (/* test */)
/* perform some action */
}
In terms of n, which Java expression represents the maximum number of times
that /* perform some action */ could be executed?
(A) n / 2
(B) (n + 1) / 2
(C) n
(D) n - 1
(E) (n - 1) / 2

(B) The maximum number will be achieved if /* test */ is true in each pass
through the loop. So the question boils down to: How many times is the loop
executed? Try one odd and one even value of n:
If n = 7, i = 0,2,4,6 Ans = 4
If n = 8, i = 0,2,4,6 Ans = 4
Notice that choice B is the only expression that works for both n = 7 and n = 8.
