9. When will method whatIsIt cause a stack overflow (i.e., cause computer memory to be exhausted)?
public static int whatIsIt(int x, int y)
{
if (x > y)
return x * y;
else
return whatIsIt(x - 1, y);
}
(A) Only when x < y
(B) Only when x ≤ y
(C) Only when x > y
(D) For all values of x and y
(E) The method will never cause a stack overflow.

9. (B) When x ≤ y, a recursive call is made to whatIsIt(x-1, y). If x decreases
at every recursive call, there is no way to reach a successful base case. Thus, the
method never terminates and eventually exhausts all available memory.
